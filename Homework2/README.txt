PARTS COMPLETED
Part 1: 
  - Program that converts grayscale pgm to binary using a given threshold
  - I used 120 for the threshold

Part 2:
  - Program that displays segmented objects with different grayscale values
  - Algorithm based on the one described at: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected-component_labeling#One_component_at_a_time]

Part 3:
  - Program that generates a database based on a labeled image and then draws lines to indicate orientation

Part 4:
  - Takes a labeled image, a database (generated by p3) and outputs a copy of the labeled image that has 
    orientation drawn on objects which have a match in the database

BUGS ENCOUNTERED
- Triggered abort when drawing lines that go off edge of image
- Viewing pgm through mac preview didn't properly display gray levels
- Didn't get exact matches across images using roundness, didn't find a modified metric to get good matches
